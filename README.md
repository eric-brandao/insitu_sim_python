# In situ impedance 

For the simulation of the acoustic impedance in various scenarios such as:
- 1 source, 1 microphone
- 1 source, 2 microphones
- 1 source, 1 pu probe
- several sources (diffuse field) and 2 microphones
- several sources (diffuse field) and pu probe
- 1 source and microphone arrays (planar, spherical)

Several sound field scenarios to be emulated: plane waves, spherical waves on locally and non-locally reactive samples,
samples limited in size.

Several impedance deduction methods will be included: plane waves, PWA, q-term, array methods and so on

In the future it is aimed to simulate scattering and scattering measurement as well.
